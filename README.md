# A general purpose reporting generator for Chaos Toolkit

[![Build, Test, and Lint](https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit-reporting/actions/workflows/build.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit-reporting/actions/workflows/build.yaml)

The Chaos Toolkit reporting extension library.

## Purpose

The purpose of this library is to provide reporting support to the
[Chaos Toolkit][chaostoolkit] experiment results.

[chaostoolkit]: https://chaostoolkit.org

## Features

The library takes the journal generated by the `chaos run` command
and transforms into a human friendly report. The report can be a standalone
PDF or HTML document.

## Install

Install this package as any other Python packages:

```console
$ pip install -U chaostoolkit-reporting
```

Notice that this draws a few [dependencies][deps]:

[deps]: https://github.com/chaostoolkit/chaostoolkit-reporting/blob/master/requirements.txt

Some of them are LGPL v3 licensed.

You will also need to [install some additional dependencies](uni-install.md) that the `chaos report` command relies upon.


## Usage

Once installed, a new `report` subcommand will be made available to the
`chaos` command, use it as follows:

```console
$ chaos report --export-format=html5 journal.json report.html
```

or, for a PDF document:

```console
$ chaos report --export-format=pdf journal.json report.pdf
```

You can also generate a single report from many journals at once:

```console
$ chaos report --export-format=pdf journal-1.json journal-2 journal-3 report.pdf
```

Or more succinctly:

```console
$ chaos report --export-format=pdf journal-*.json report.pdf
```

## Download a Docker Image

As the dependencies for this plugin can be difficult to get right, we also
provide a docker image - note that this image is rather big with 1.4Gb to
pull. You can install `Docker` from the [Docker Hub][dockerhub].

[dockerhub]: https://hub.docker.com/search?q=&type=edition&offering=community

```console
$ docker pull chaostoolkit/reporting
```

### Use a Docker container

To generate a PDF report using the Docker image you must first ensure that you are running the command from where the `journal.json`
file, generated during an experiment run, can be found. To check for this you can run:


```console
$ ls
```

And you should see the `journal.json` file:

```
journal.json
```

Now you can run the docker command:

```console
$ docker run \
    --user `id -u` \
    -v `pwd`:/tmp/result \
    -it \
    chaostoolkit/reporting
```

This will create `chaostoolkit.log` and `report.pdf` files in this directory.

```console
$ ls
```

```
chaostoolkit.log   journal.json   report.pdf
```

The `report.json` file will be owned by the user id returned by the command `id -u`, it should
be your user. The reason we specify a user is that, by default, the container
runs as root and the image doesn't make a guess about which user will run
the container. If you don't have the `id` command you can set the value
manually as follows instead: `--user 1000:1000` assuming both your user and
group ids are `1000`.

The default command of the image is equivalent to running this without a
container:

```console
$ chaos report --export-format=pdf journal.json report.pdf
```

If you wish to override that command, pass the `chaos report` parameters as
follows:

```console
$ docker run \
    --user `id -u` \
    -v `pwd`:/tmp/result \
    -it \
    chaostoolkit/reporting -- report --export-format=html5 journal.json report.html

```

And the same files will be created:

```console
$ ls
```

```
chaostoolkit.log   journal.json   report.pdf
```
